An interactive platform that simplifies the process of writing assignments and coding, providing real-time feedback and an engaging user experience.

## Features

- Run will verify the first test case and then submit the rest of the test cases.
  So run is basically for checking the first test case and then submit the rest of the test cases.

- We can open a modal for the result of run and it auto closes as we click outside of it.
  Here we can check for all compilation errors and runtime errors.

- Add an issue section where queries can get resolved

- Leaderboard section ( maybe )
